# ldap

Uses Spring Security to hit against an embedded copy of ForumSystems' LDAP test server 
(http://www.forumsys.com/tutorials/integration-how-to/ldap/online-ldap-test-server/) to do basic authentication of a
user and filter which pages they get access to ("/", "/chemists/", and/or "/mathematicians/").
